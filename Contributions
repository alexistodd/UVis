1/13/2022 11:00 am - 1:00 pm Steven Amberman : Worked on the setup and configuration for the new Raspberry Pi B. Initial hardware cconstruction completed with the screen, rasp pi,
and nior camera.

1/13/2022 11:20 am - 1:00 pm Joseph Pacifici : Created a schematic which will be used to create the casing that holds the UVShield with all of its components. Discussed potential battery power solutions and sizes to fit the discussed case. Designed the overall boot screen, display, and shut down.

1/13/2022 11:00 am - 1:00 pm Beckett Hoefling : Helped with the setup and configuration for the new Raspberry Pi B. Set up remote vnc connection and getting touchscreen working.

1/13/2022 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm Alexis todd: Helped connect rasp pi to laptop and met with team to discuss future responsibilities

1/13/2022 11:30pm - 1:00 pm Arthur Guimaraes: Helped with the schematic for the UVShield. Research potential components for the device such as LEDs, switches, buttons and battery.

1/18/2022 11:15 - 12:15 pm Alexis Todd: Researched on running application at startup and soldering the power button and LED switches

1/18/2022 10:40 am - 12:40 pm Beckett Hoefling : Began designing the schematics for the build and created a logo for the startup screen.

1/18/2022 10:30 am - 3:00 pm Steven Amberman: Purchased lithuim ion battery to power the raspberry pi. Took device measurements and began solidworks construction for case.

1/18/2022 12:00pm - 3:00pm Arthur Guimaraes: Started coding the raspberry pi to run the command line for the camera at startup.

1/18/2022 10:30 am - 3:00pm Joseph Pacifici: Identified proper screws that will be used to facen the casing to the UVShield. Created branches for solidWorks and for the python
code which will be used for start up and shut down. Worked on raspberry pi with Arthur to run the cammera at startup.

1/19/2022 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm Beckett Hoefling : Finished designing the schematics for the build and revised the logo for the startup screen.

1/20/2022 10:30 am - 2:00 pm Steven Amberman : Built hardware implementation to test button functionality to power the UV LEDs. Created alpha test plan documentation, and bill of materials for current state of project.

1/20/2022 10:30 am - 2:00 pm Joseph Pacifici : Identified and implemented how to boot raspberri pi into the camera application with full screen upon power up. Learned the power output capablities of the GPIO pins and helped to create the beginnings of the LED python application.

1/20/2022 11:00 pm - 1:00 pm Beckett Hoefling : Researched how to add a custom loading screen for the device and how to add a power button.

1/20/2022 11:00 pm - 2:00 pm Alexis Todd : Working with buttons and creating a thread to run camera and button input at the same time. 

1/21/2022 8:00 pm - 9:00 pm Steven Amberman : Setup and performed alpha build demo, submitted alpha build & alpha test documents.  

1/25/2022 9:30 pm - 10:30 pm Alexis Todd: Researched on adding more depth to camera code

1/25/2022 10:30 pm - 1:00 pm Beckett Hoefling : Setup a custom boot screen with our logo. Began testing the battery power for the device and tested UV leds with the camera.

1/29/2022 12:00 pm - 3:00 pm Alexis Todd : Fixed button debouncing, added extra button for debug or power support, added appropriate threads to run camera, use lights, and shutdown device appropriately

2/1/2022 10:00 am - 11:30 pm Steven Amberman: Soldered lipo battery to power modules, soldered usb power supply and wires. Troubleshooting began on power, charge up confirmed. Still having issues with constant power supply.

2/1/2022 1:30 pm - 2:30 pm Steven Amberman: Soldered LED light strip. Tested functionality.

2/1/2022 11:30 am - 4:30 pm Arthur Guimaraes: Shutdown button functionality, debug some issues at startup. Research to implement the logo at startup from the terminal rather than the desktop.

2/1/2022 10:30 pm - 1:30 pm Beckett Hoefling : Tested various LED configurations with the camera.

2/1/2022 10:30 pm - 1:30 pm Alexis Todd : Helped solder LED light strip, discussed case design, found information on UF 3D printing, discussed roadmap and priorities, ordered supplies for wire wrapping.

2/1/222 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm Joseph Pacifici : Help to create a start up image to be displayed before booting into camera mode.

2/2/2022 2:00pm - 5:00 pm Steven Amberman: Debug corrupted SD card for PI OS. Cleaned, reformatted, and reinstalled Raspian OS on the SD card. Purchased glass cutter, and made cuts to UV filter.

2/3/2022 10:30am - 1:30pm Arthur Guimaraes: Helped on the SolidWorks case design.

2/3/2022 4:00pm - 5:30pm Arthur Guimaraes: Fixed the camera issue not properly working. Added the python code to initiliaze after the desktop and fixed the proper adjusment to the LCD screen.
