Notes:
        omxplyer is no longer avaliable through sudo apt-get omxplayer so an alternate method is described below in Step 2.
        If any library or bash is no longer avaliable hopefully there is an archive.
        VLC was not able to be run during bootup to display video.
        There are two methods for creating a boot video. Method 1 makes it so that the splash image is displayed for a longer duration but does not display the video.
            Method 2 correctly displays the video after the splash image.

Steps:
        1. Create a video of type .mp4 format to be displayed upon boot up and send it to the Raspberry pi over VNC
            a. VLC should already be installed on the pi from regular installation.
        2. Get omxplayer
            a. Navigate to Link B which is the archives for omxplayer
            b. Download omxplayer_20190723+gitf543a0d-1+bullseye_armhf.deb file (Also avaliable within this gitHub)
                i. Move it over to raspberry Pi through VNC
                ii. Install it by either right clicking on the package and selecting install or...
                    $ sudo dpkg --install omxplayer_20190723+gitf543a0d-1+bullseye_armhf.deb (while in the correct directory with the terminal)
            c. Install aptitude
                i. sudo apt-get install aptitude
            d. Install the libaries for omxplayer
                $ sudo aptitude install libavcodec58 libavutil56 libswresample3 libavformat58
            e. Update the pi
                $ sudo rpi-update
            f. Open "/boot/config.txt" ($ sudo nano /boot/config.txt")
                i. Comment out # dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
            g. Reboot the pi
    
    Method 1: A service method
        3. Make sure you have omxplayer installed correctly
            a. Test by running ($ omxplayer your_video.mp4) within the terminal
        4. Create this init script with your editor in /etc/init.d/asplashscreen
            $ sudo nano /etc/init.d/asplashscreen
        5. Paste the code below and replace "boot.mp4" with your_video.mp4" 
            i. The & at the end of boot.mp4 means that it will run in the background
#! /bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO

do_start () {

    omxplayer /home/pi/boot.mp4 &  
    exit 0
}

case "$1" in
  start|"")
    do_start
    ;;

    echo "Error: argument '$1' not supported" >&2
    exit 3
    ;;

    # No-op

    exit 0
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: asplashscreen [start|stop]" >&2
    exit 3
    ;;
esac

:
        6. Run these commands
            $ sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/asplashscreen (create the service)
            $ sudo systemctl enable asplashscreen (enable the service)
        7. Reboot the pi and run the commands again
            $ sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/asplashscreen (create the service)
            $ sudo systemctl enable asplashscreen (enable the service)
            $ sudo systemctl start aspalshscreen (start the service to check if it works, this should display the video)
            $ sudo systemctl status asplashscreen (This can be used for debugging, no need to run it)
    
    Method 2: Tom's Hardware setup
        3. Open "/etc/rc.local" ($ sudo nano /etc/rc.local)
        4. After fi but before exit 0 insert the line below
            $ omxplayer /home/pi/your_video.mp4 &
        5. Save and reboot the pi and the video should play after the splash screen image
